To install it you need to set-up your python3 environment and install any Python libraries that you want to use. I'm on Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) so for me that was apt for the python3 parts and then I use pip3 for local libraries (numpy, matplotlib, etc).

```bash
    $ sudo apt install libpython3.6-dev python3-pip
    $ pip3 install --user numpy pandas matplotlib
```
